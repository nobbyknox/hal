# README

HAL accidentally came to stands for *Home Automation Leader* after I first used
the acronym to paint similarities between this software and the main protagonist
in the movie *2001: A Space Odyssey*.

HAL is a uniquely bespoke system that operates on my precise hardware, including
Raspberry PI, Razberry Z-Wave controller, and Z-Wave home automation devices.
Unmodified, it will work nowhere else.

## Development Branches

### feature/bourne-again

This is where version 2.0 is being constructed. This branch will eventually
become the `develop` branch.

### feature/uuid

Trying out UUID strings as primary keys for database tables.

### research/okay-nav

Trying out the okayNav thing. Simple and pretty, but doesn't play well
with Angular.
