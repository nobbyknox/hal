HAL accidentally came to stands for *Home Automation Leader* after I first used
the acronym to paint similarities between this software and the main protagonist
in the movie *2001: A Space Odyssey*.

HAL is a uniquely bespoke system that operates on my precise hardware, including
Raspberry PI, Razberry Z-Wave controller, and Z-Wave home automation devices.
Unmodified, it will work nowhere else.
